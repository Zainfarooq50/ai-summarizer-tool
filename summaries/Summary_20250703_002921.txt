Paragraphs are essential components of any written work. While some students may define paragraphs based on length or appearance, what truly defines a paragraph is the unity and coherence of ideas among sentences. A paragraph is a group of sentences or a single sentence that forms a unit supporting a main idea, also known as the controlling idea. Length and appearance do not dictate whether a section in a paper qualifies as a paragraph, as some writing styles allow for paragraphs to be just one sentence long.
